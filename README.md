# whatTheDuckIsThis

## “If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.”
Js is a beautiful language. However, growing up it made some interesting decisions in its life regarding how it wanted to behave and what it could do. As a result the developer has a large amount of options in how they are able to handle the idiosyncrasies of the language. Fundamentally however, js was designed as a prototypical dynamic functional language as a result I believe that writing code which takes advantage of that is the ideal way to write. That being said, things such as class syntax has been added in which allows for syntax that matches the standard of programming although fundamentally the code compiles into prototype based objects.

## why I wrote this
Js is a duck type language. Meaning it thrives when code is written to handle many different types of ducks, be many different types of ducks, and group ducks together. Duck typing  means that if two or more unrelated objects respond to the same method name that means they can be handled the same way (treated like the same type of duck). What this means is not only can we use the core concepts of oop like in class based languages but we can take it WAY further. So as a result the goal of writing this is to create documentation and important things to note about the ideal ways to write in js in order to save pain later by making poor syntactic decisions or hopping around from one style to another within the same project. Ultimately I want to do this to help you and me keep our ducks in order.

## legal disclaimer
You gotta be a good bit full of yourself to think that you are worthy of writing a book on how to do something correctly. Although I definitely struggle with that issue, I’m also extremely insecure and tend to doubt the decisions I make when writing code. Constantly trying new things is what has allowed me to learn what's a mistake in the language and what is usually good practice. This is both here to help me keep my ducks in order and also help people from getting sporadic information from stack overflow, like how to use private fields (yuck).

Furthermore, just because things are done a certain way doesn't mean that there is not a better way. As a result, I would absolutely adore input and critiques of what I've gathered as an up and coming developer who simply loves talking about code.

Although this book is outdated I recommend it as it will cause you to question everything thus forcing you to have defined opinions about js topics:
